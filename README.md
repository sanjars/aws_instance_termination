This is simple script to terminate AWS instances from the file using Boto3. While running this script, you want to make sure that the listed 'stopped' instances in the first part of the script are all instances that you have in the file. If the instance, is not amongst the other instances, then it is running. So, abort the script and double check the list again. 

In addition, the file needs to have only Instance IDs in a single column. Feel free to copy and use it for your own needs. I am not responsible for any actions that you may do wrongly with your instances. Remember to be careful when running this script.
